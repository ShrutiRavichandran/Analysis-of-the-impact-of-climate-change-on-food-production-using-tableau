# Analysis-of-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-food-production-using-tableau
This project aims to analyze the impact of climate change on the food production by combining emissions data, temperature data, and food production data. The project uses publicly available datasets year-on-year emissions data by country from FAOSTAT, timeâ€“series average temperature anomaly data collected globally from Berkeley data, to establish the effect of climate change in the agriculture industry using food production data also obtained from FAOSTAT.
